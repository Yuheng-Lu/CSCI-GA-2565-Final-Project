The training process for the SpoilerNet model is detailed in the `notebooks/model_implementation.ipynb` notebook. The trained model file should be included in the `models/` directory. If you would like to train the model yourself, refer to the notebook for instructions. However, due to the size of the trained model file, I did not include it in the repository. You may download it following this Google drive link: [complete_model.pth](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j9bsl7ZXRF2jSm5WCzunO8MiNsk64pyj/view?usp=sharing) (NYU email required).
